# react-redux-boilerplate
My personal boilerplate to quickly setup new react / redux based projects.

Includes (so far):

* Basic folder structure for components, styles and tests;
* Webpack configuration for development and production;
* React and redux integration;
* Hot Module Replacement;
* Routing using connected-react-router;
* Eslint configuration (airbnb);
* Polyfills with babel-polyfill;
* Unit testing with jest and enzyme;
* Code coverage with Istanbul;
* Documentation with JSDoc 3.
